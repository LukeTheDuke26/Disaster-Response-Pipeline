## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project is part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight. The initial dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disasters. The aim of the project is to build a Natural Language Processing tool that categorize messages.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories.
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

## Project Components <a name="components"></a>

There are three components of this project:

### 1. ETL Pipeline (Process Data) <a name="ETL"></a>

A Python script, `process_data.py`, is written to perform the following tasks:

- Load the `messages` and `categories` dataset
- Merge the two datasets
- Clean the data
- Store the data in a SQLite database

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline (Build Model) <a name="ml"></a>

In progress

### 3. Flask Web App (Run Web App) <a name="flask"></a>

In progress
